# Project Title: Top-Up Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing top-up transaction data and member characteristics to build predictive models. The initial work was done using **Stata**, and the project will later include **Python code** for future reference.

## Context and Motivation
The project originated from organisational interest to encourage members to transition from using hardcopy transactions to electronic transactions. The goal was to better understand the behaviors and characteristics associated with hardcopy usage, so that targeted interventions could be designed to increase the adoption of electronic transactions.

As part of this initiative, I was tasked with analyzing transaction data to understand what drives members' preference for hardcopy transactions and how different factors influence this behavior. This analysis aims to provide insights that can inform future strategies for improving electronic transaction adoption.

The data used in this project is highly sensitive. Due to privacy concerns and confidentiality agreements, the raw data and results of this analysis cannot be shared in this repository.

## Impact
In this project, I applied statistical analysis to segment users into different categories based on their behavior and demographics. Findings were presented to senior management and relevant departments, where they played a critical role in shaping strategies for improving the transition to electronic transactions. I communicated these results in a way that was accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences. 

This segmentation allowed for the creation of targeted recommendations that aimed to increase the adoption of electronic transactions. By identifying key factors influencing user preferences for hardcopy transactions, the models provided insights that informed the design of more effective interventions.

## Key Features of the Project:
- **CART Models:** Used for building classification trees to analyze different segments of the population based on top-up behaviors and member characteristics.
- **Logistic Regression:** Applied to predict hardcopy usage based on various factors such as age, gender, race, employment status, and others.
- **CHAID Analysis:** Performed on both transaction-level and individual-level data to explore segmentation based on different features and interaction effects.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes merging, cleaning, and transforming raw data into usable formats for analysis. This involved handling missing values, creating categorical variables, and generating new features. The careful attention to detail in data cleaning is crucial in dealing with large and messy datasets, ensuring that the resulting models are both accurate and robust.

## Iterative Approach
The analysis has been conducted in an iterative manner, with the project gradually evolving to include input and suggestions from different stakeholders. Over time, different variables were added or removed based on insights gained in each phase.

- The latest versions of the Stata code are shared here. 
- In the future, Python code will be added to replicate and extend the Stata analysis. This will allow for the exploration of more advanced techniques and integration with modern data science libraries. My goal is to demonstrate my versatility by showcasing my ability to handle data and build models in both Stata and Python.

## Skills Highlighted:
- **Data Handling:** A strong focus on data cleaning and transformation. This project involved working with relatively messy and large datasets, which required careful handling to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the results.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Expertise in building predictive models using techniques such as **CART**, **Logistic Regression**, and **CHAID** to classify and segment members based on transaction behavior.
- **Python & Stata Proficiency:** The project highlights my ability to work in **Stata** for statistical analysis and **Python** for scalable, modern data science workflows. Future Python code will be integrated into the project to demonstrate my proficiency in Python programming, particularly in using libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels`.
